# This repository will contain files allowing users to compute alternative estimates 
# of the number of eligible voters in  Portuguese legislative elections. 
# These estimates offer an alternative to official data which are inflated due 
# to outdated electoral records. 
#
# The script uses data downloaded from Pordata. Since these data are not available 
# through an API, the necessary files will be included in the GitHub repository. 
# Alternatively, URLs that enable users to download updated data 
# are also included in the script.
