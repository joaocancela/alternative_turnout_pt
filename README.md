# alternative_turnout_pt
This repository will contain files allowing users to compute alternative estimates  of the number of eligible voters in  Portuguese legislative elections. 
These estimates offer an alternative to official data which are inflated due   to outdated electoral records. 
The script uses data downloaded from Pordata. Since these data are not available  through an API, the necessary files will be included in the GitHub repository. 
Alternatively, URLs that enable users to download the most updated data are also included in the script.

The files will be included here as soon as a robust version is ready. Meanwhile, if you want to get in touch feel free to reach me at joaocancela@fcsh.unl.pt
